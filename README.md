# Desktop Icon Toggle

Desktop Icon Toggle is a simple Windows tool, that allows you to quickly toggle the visibility of desktop icons by double-clicking the blank space on the desktop.

After installation, launch the app from the start menu or restart your computer. The app will start automatically when you log in to Windows, and can be suspended or disabled in the taskbar.

The zip file contains the app installer that will automatically add the app to startup, and a standalone binary of the app.
